1.Create number of instances of B application.
2.override properties
	.Server.port
3.Identify which application will send the load.
4.make that application as load balancer which A application
5.add dependency of ribbon in that application.
"<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon</artifactId>
 </dependency>"
4.then create a config.java file in that particular application(which is our load balancer)
5.@Configuration
public class CustomerConfig {

	@Bean @LoadBalanced
	RestTemplate restTemplate() {
		return new RestTemplate();
	}
}
this will be code inside that config.java
6.autowire it in controller.
@Autowire
RestTemplate restTemplate;
7.Replace or use load balanced restTemplate instead of create a new object and should be done
  only the method where your sending request B application
8.and annote it with @RibbonClient(name="custribbon") on class level.
	custribbon is name of client.which will send request to B.
9.where step 7 in performed give this url there "http://custribbon/customers(this is hardcoded value)/"
10.Go to application.properties and add
	custribbon.ribbon.eureka.enabled=false
	custribbon.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8301,http://localhost:8300(this are hardcoded values)
